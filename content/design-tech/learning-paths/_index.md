# Summary
Make into three buckets: 
1. Company problems to solve
2. Key constraint / difficulties
3. Spoilers: Key accomplishments

Team of 4. Proj started as exploration, turned into key deliverable in DevHub project. Transitioned ways of working to make this work. I WAS ONLY UX/UI/RESEARCH/Technical background. Others were content and technical only -- experts in their own right. Initiative started isolated, then fit into overall Developer Hub launch. I was linkage to these teams.

Problems: /data insights, we are in middle of dev program. Devs care about docs, sample code, and tutorials the MOST!!! We have minimal for SW devs, need to expand
Create PROCESS and FRAMEWORK for All Arm people and more to contribute to grow content exponentially.
Organize data in a sensible way in an extremely constrained resource environment, starting only from broad requirements.

Constraints: ISSUSE

Spoilers: After one year, the following:
- 275 Learning Paths

- 552,929 content views
- 43,100 via Google
- 685 daily visitors

- Feedback: "Easy to Understand"
- 31 NPS score (great)


# My Process

{{< text_picture image="learning-path-main.PNG" alt="Description of the image" >}}
Armed only with high-level business requirements, a company-wide design system, and the skills of our team, the first decision to make was how make decisions. For such open-ended projects, I find the popular Design Thinking approach ideal for rapid progress while remaining focused on the end customer experience.

I based my creation process on the 5 step Stanford d.school Design Thinking framework of Empathize, Define, Ideate, Prototype, and Test. Recognizing our team's limited resources, hand-over requirements, and standard Arm ways of working, I adjusted this to work better by condensing Prototype & Test into one functional step and adding two more:
- Empathize -briefly describe
- Define - briefly describe
- Ideate - briefly describe
- Prototype & Test - briefly describe
- Implement - briefly describe
- Launch & Optimize  - briefly describe
